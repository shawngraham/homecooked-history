# Early American Settlements Historical Map

This project creates an interactive web map showing the development of early American settlements from 1600 to 1800. It demonstrates the use of Leaflet.js, Omnivore, and other web mapping technologies for historical data visualization.

## Features

- Interactive timeline slider to explore settlements by year
- Animation feature to watch settlement progression
- Custom markers for different types of settlements
- Popup information for each historical site
- Marker clustering for better visualization
- Mobile-responsive design

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[username]/historical-map-project.git
cd historical-map-project
```

2. If you want to run it locally, you'll need a local server due to CORS restrictions. You can use Python's built-in server:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

3. To deploy to GitHub Pages:
- Push the code to your repository
- Go to Settings â†’ Pages
- Enable GitHub Pages from main branch
- Visit `https://[username].github.io/historical-map-project`

## Data Structure

The historical data is stored in `data/historical-sites.csv` with the following structure:
- name: Name of the settlement
- latitude: Decimal degrees
- longitude: Decimal degrees
- year: Year of establishment
- type: Type of settlement (colony, settlement, or trading_post)
- description: Brief historical description

## Technologies Used

- Leaflet.js for mapping
- Leaflet.markercluster for clustering
- Leaflet-omnivore for CSV parsing
- Stamen terrain tiles for base map

## Customization

To add your own historical data:
1. Modify the `historical-sites.csv` file with your data
2. Adjust the year range in `index.html` (yearSlider min/max)
3. Modify marker icons and colors in `map.js`
4. Update styles in `styles.css`

## Query Wikidata for more data

Run the script: python wikidata-historical-sites.py

requirements:
requests>=2.25.1

# Basic usage (defaults to 1600-1800 in United States)
python wikidata-historical-sites.py

# Custom year range
python wikidata-historical-sites.py -s 1500 -e 1700

# Different location (e.g., Canada is Q16)
python wikidata-historical-sites.py -l Q16

# Custom output filename
python wikidata-historical-sites.py -o north-american-settlements.csv

make sure to pip install requests

SPARQL Query Breakdown
The script uses a sophisticated SPARQL query that:

Filters for settlements, colonies, forts, and cities
Checks for founding date within specified range
Retrieves English names and descriptions
Extracts geographic coordinates
Handles various settlement types

Limitations and Potential Improvements

Wikidata coverage varies by region and period
Some sites might lack coordinates or precise founding dates
Current limit of 100 results (can be adjusted)

Potential Enhancements for Historians

Add more specific type filtering
Implement more robust coordinate parsing
Add support for multiple locations in one query
Create a more comprehensive description generation
