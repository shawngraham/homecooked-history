[3] A Letter Missive in regard to the Conversion and Baptism of the
Grand Sagamore of new France, who was, before the arrival of the
French, its chief and sovereign.


SIR and Brother, I did not wish the ship to depart without giving you
some news of this country which I believe will be acceptable, as I know
that you are a good Catholic. The Grand Sagamore, whom we call in our
language Grand Captain of the Savages, and chief of all, was baptized
on last saint John the Baptist's day; [4] with his wife, children, and
children's children, to the number of twenty; with as much enthusiasm,
fervor, and zeal for Religion as would have been evinced by a person
who had been instructed in it for three or four years. He promises to
have the others baptized, or else make war upon them. [_The news of the
King's death had not then reached Canada._] Monsieur de Poutrincourt
and his son acted as sponsors for them in the name of the King, and
of Monseigneur the Dauphin. We have already made this good beginning,
which I believe will become still better hereafter. As to the country,
I have never seen anything so beautiful, better, or more fertile;
and I can say to you, truly and honestly, that if I had three or
four Laborers with me now, and [5] the means of supporting them for
one year, and some wheat to sow in the ground tilled by their labor
alone, I should expect to have a yearly trade in Beaver and other
Skins amounting to seven or eight thousand livres, with the surplus
which would remain to me after their support. I am very sorry that I
did not know before my departure what I know now; if I had, I should
have left no stone unturned to bring with me two or three farmers,
and two hogsheads of wheat, which is a mere trifle. I assure you it
is delightful to engage in trade over here and to make such handsome
profits. If you wish to take a hand in it, let me know your intentions
by the bearer, who desires to return and traffic here in pursuance of
what he has seen. I [6] shall say no more, except to pray God to give
you, Sir and Brother, a long life and perfect health. From Port Royal,
New France, this 28th of June, 1610.

  _Your very affectionate Brother and servant_,
  BERTRAND.
